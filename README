This is an alternative code from the Hot Cross Bunny example that I would share with you guys...
I took essentially the cueShot function from the simple pool example and I transformed it into a catapult, different from an angry bird type of game, but with the same game mechanic in it.

Don't forget to leave comments and thoughts on this if you have any...
